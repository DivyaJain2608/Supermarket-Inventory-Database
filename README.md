The project models a Retail Supermarket and focuses on products, suppliers, purchases, stock management, sales billing, customers, employees, and store operations.

The goal of the project was to design and implement a relational database for a Supermarket Management System.  
Keeping this in mind, the database focuses on:

- Managing products, categories, brands, and pricing  
- Handling suppliers, purchase orders, and GRN receipts  
- Tracking batches, inventory stock levels, and store transfers  
- Capturing customer information and loyalty points  
- Supporting billing, payments, coupons, and returns  
- Managing employees, roles, departments, attendance, and shifts  
- Representing real-world relational dependencies across modules
